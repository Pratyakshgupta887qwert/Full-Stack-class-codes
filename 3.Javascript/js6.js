// DOM(document object model)  : Dom is in browser

// DOM is like a remote control for your webpage —
// it lets JavaScript read, edit, and add stuff to HTML while the page is running.

Root --> HTML --> HEAD --> BODY --> h1

what is the difference between DOM and BOM (Browser object model)

>> DOM (Document Object Model) controls the **webpage content** — it lets JavaScript change or read elements inside the HTML, like text, images, or buttons.
BOM (Browser Object Model) controls the **browser itself** — it lets JavaScript work with things like the window, history, URL, and alerts.
In short, **DOM = inside the page**, **BOM = around the page (browser)**.
