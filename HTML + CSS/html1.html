Meta tags are snippets of text that provide information about a webpage to search engines and other software that reads web pages. They are placed within the <head> section of the HTML + CSS code and are not visible to website visitors. Three key uses of meta tags are: describing page content for search engines, controlling how search engines index your site, and optimizing for mobile viewing.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Describing page content for search engines:
Meta descriptions (e.g., <meta name="description" content="...">) provide a brief summary of the page's content, which search engines often display in search results. This helps users understand what the page is about before clicking on it. 

2. Controlling how search engines index your site:
Meta robots tags (e.g., <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">) tell search engine crawlers which pages to index (or not) and whether to follow links on that page. This allows website owners to manage how their site is crawled and indexed by search engines. 

3. Optimizing for mobile viewing:
The viewport meta tag (e.g., <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">) is crucial for responsive design. It instructs browsers how to adjust page dimensions and scaling for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on mobile devices.
