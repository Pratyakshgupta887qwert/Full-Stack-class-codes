Difference between transition and animation :

Transition 👉 Smooth change from one style to another, but it only happens when something triggers it (like hover, click, etc).
Example: A button smoothly changes color when you hover over it.

Animation 👉 A planned set of moves that can run on its own, even without hover. You can make it repeat, bounce, spin, etc.
Example: A ball keeps bouncing up and down automatically.

⚡ Shortcut to remember:

Transition = “change smoothly when something happens”
Animation = “move however I want, whenever I want”
